    Parent class for each world. Worlds are defined by:
    -A set of object instances (e.g., walls, balls, agents, etc)
    -One or more controllers that are trained to control one or more agents
    -If necessary, one or more controllers used to control opposing agents.

    Each world will also require several methods be defined in the child class:
    -reset() will reinitialize all objects in the world
    -update_score() will recalculate the score of each agent based on the state
    -terminate_run() is optional, will determine if the current world should be terminal (e.g., a goal is scored)
    -get_state() returns the state of each agent to be used by the controller
    -get_num_actions() returns the number of actions available to each agent
